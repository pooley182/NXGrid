# NXGrid

Simple CSS Grid framework.

Based on the popular twitter bootstrap but stripped down and re-written for my own needs.

- NXGrid.less uncompiled less with compiling options.
- NXGrid.css Pre-compiled 16 column framework.
- NXGrid-12.css Pre-compiled 12 column framework.
- Demo 12 and Demo 16 contain example HTML to show how to use the framework
